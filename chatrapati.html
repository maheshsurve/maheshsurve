            [8] The exact date of birth of <b style="font-family: cursive;">Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b> is a matter
            of disagreement among historians.<br>
            The Maharashtra state government accepted the birth date of <em>Lord Shiva</em> in 2001 as Falgun Vadya
            Tritiya Shaka
            1551 (Friday, 19 February 1630).<br>
            [9] Among other possible dates, April 6, 1627 (Vaishakh Shuddh Tritiya) was considered a date of birth.
            [10]<br>
            The Government of Maharashtra has listed 19 February as a holiday to commemorate the birth anniversary of
            <strong> Shivaji Maharaj</strong>.

            In 1636, the Adil Royal Sultanate of Bijapur invaded the southern states. [30] The sultanate had
            recently become
            a kingdom of the<em> Mughal Empire</em>.<br></p>

            <b>Shahaji raje</b> was then a chieftain of the hilly regions of western
            India and was helping adilshahi. Shahajiraje was looking for opportunities for the reward of Jahangir in the
            conquered region, on which he could collect annual taxes.

        <h3><u>Conflict And Bijapur Sultanate</u></h3>
        <p>
            In 1646, taking advantage of the chaos created in the <strong>Bijapur</strong> court due to the illness of
            the Sultan,
            16-year-old <b>Shivaji</b> took the <em><b>Torna fort</b></em> and seized the large treasure found there.
            [38] [39] Over the next
            two years, Shivaji took several important forts near Pune.<br>
            <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Isq7ThEWDh42p1X42b6FSFOJJL5T4AlWH-sUzsqE-7ET5mqoeAFyRFY-s1az8d631IuMwB8wAajfIIDt1e1tAJgXzBTjrNg3BWGZigsNM7TSE1nNaUnzYThAd9TiR5T7Mg=w1280">
            These include Purandhar, Kondhana and Chakan.
            They also took direct control of <em> Supe, Baramati and Indapur</em>. They conquered the mountain of
            Murumbadev in
            front of Torangad and repaired it and named it Rajgad. [40] For this, they used the treasure found at
            Torana. Rajgarh was their capital for more than a decade.
